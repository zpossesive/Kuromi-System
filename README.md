# Discord Bot Setup
Overview
This repository contains the code for a Discord bot built using discord.js. The bot allows users to interact with Discord servers using custom commands. This README will guide you through setting up and running the bot on your machine.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
- Discord Account: You will need a Discord account and a bot created on the Discord Developer Portal.
## Steps to Setup the Bot

## 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/zpossesive/Kuromi-System.git
cd your-repository-name
```
## 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
npm install discord.js
npm install dotenv
```
This will install the discord.js library and other required packages.

## 3. Create a .env File
To store your botâ€™s token and client ID securely, create a .env file in the root of your project folder. The .env file should contain the following information:

(file name is .env)
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token-here
CLIENT_ID=your-discord-client-id-here
```
Replace your-discord-bot-token-here with your bot's actual token and your-discord-client-id-here with the client ID of your bot.

To obtain your bot's token and client ID:

Go to the [Discord Developer Portal.](https://discord.com/developers)
Select your bot application.
Under Bot, you will find your token. Click Copy to copy the token.
Under General Information, you will find your Client ID.

## 4. Run the Bot
Now that everything is set up, you can run the bot locally by executing the following command:

```
node index.js
```
If everything is set up correctly, the bot will log in and be ready to use. You should see something like:

```
Good evening, sir. All systems operational and ready for your commands.
```
## 5. Troubleshooting
If the bot fails to start or encounters errors, make sure the .env file is properly set up and contains the correct values.
Ensure that discord.js is installed. If you encounter missing modules, try running npm install again.

Additional Notes
Security Reminder: Never share your .env file with anyone, and ensure that it is excluded from version control (using .gitignore).
Bot Token: The token should be kept private at all times. If your token is compromised, you can regenerate it from the Discord Developer Portal.
